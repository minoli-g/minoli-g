## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Minoli, a software engineer with 2 YOE in the development of low-latency electronic FX trading systems, with a focus on market data feed processing. I am skilled in C++ and Java, but I can adapt to anything pretty quick. I take ownership of everything I work on, and always attempt to ensure I deliver things to the best possible quality. I prioritize code cleanliness and maintainability, and develop with architectural and strategic concerns in mind.

I enjoy learning about advanced data structures and algorithms, computer architecture and system design. A couple of my pet projects are <a href="https://github.com/minoli-g/squaredle-solver"> Squaredle Solver </a>, a word game solver which uses a Trie, a cool type of data structure, and <a href="https://github.com/minoli-g/intel-x86-emulator"> An Intel x86 Emulator </a>, which emulates all stages of the instruction decoding in an Intel x86 32-bit processor. 

I graduated with a first class from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
