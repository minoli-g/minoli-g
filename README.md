## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Minoli, a software engineer with experience in backend development, particularly in fintech & REST APIs. I typically code in C++ and Java, but I'm adept at picking up new languages and frameworks. I take ownership of the features I implement, and always attempt to ensure I deliver things to the best possible quality. I prioritize code cleanliness and maintainability, and develop with architectural and strategic concerns in mind.

I enjoy learning about advanced data structures and algorithms, computer architecture and system design. A couple of my pet projects are <a href="https://github.com/minoli-g/squaredle-solver"> Squaredle Solver </a>, a word game solver which uses a Trie, a cool type of data structure, and <a href="https://github.com/minoli-g/intel-x86-emulator"> An Intel x86 Emulator </a>, which emulates all stages of the instruction decoding in an Intel x86 32-bit processor. 

I graduated with a first class from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
